# Infrared Motion Sensor Smart-Home Integration

# Name - Ryan Heiert

---

# Project Overview:

I will be developing a system to mimic the universal studios wand interactions for personal use in a smart home system. Technology could be achieved through different methods, but the result would be allowing a physical motion with a "wand" to run commands interfacing with physical tech or google smart systems.

---

# Sprint 1:

-Recognize and differentiate specific motions

-Get commands to activate various smarthome systems

-Use commands to run pc programs

---

# Sprint 2:

-Create a system to connect motion input to commands

-Experiment with commands to activate physical motors?

---

# Technologies and Tools:

-"Wand" (IR reflector, motion sensor, wii remote, etc.)

-Receiver (camera setup, sensor bar, etc.)

-Raspberry pi

---

# AI Tools:

## Learning with AI
- Using AI to learn about the problem domain technologies
- Checking code for mistakes/alternative techniques

## AI Integration
- Potentially using AI for image recognition to detect unique motions
