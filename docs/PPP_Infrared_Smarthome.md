Individual Project - Ryan Heiert
Project Title:

Infrared Motion Sensor Smart-Home Integration

---

Project Overview:

I will be developing a system to mimic the universal studios wand interactions for personal use in a smart home system. Technology could be achieved through different methods, but the result would be allowing a physical motion with a "wand" to run commands interfacing with physical tech or google smart systems.

Project Goals:

-Recognize and differentiate specific motions

-Allow commands to activate various smarthome systems

-Use commands to run programs

-Experiment with commands to activate physical motors

Technologies and Tools:

-"Wand" (IR reflector, motion sensor, wii remote, etc.)

-Receiver (camera setup, sensor bar, etc.)

-Arduino

-Raspberry pi

AI Tools:

test
